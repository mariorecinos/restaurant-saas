## Problem Solved

Independent restaurants lose 20–30% of every order to marketplace platforms like DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats. On a $35 order, that's $10.50 gone — and restaurants typically operate on 3–9% margins. RestaurantSaaS gives restaurants their own branded ordering page with delivery powered by DoorDash Drive at a flat $7–$9.75 per delivery (not 30%), and $0 for pickup orders. Restaurants keep their profits, customers get the same delivery experience, and the platform pays for itself from day one.
