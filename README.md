## 🚀 What It Does

RestaurantSaaS is a platform where independent restaurants can:

- **Sign up and create a branded ordering page** in under 5 minutes
- **Accept delivery orders** powered by DoorDash Drive at a flat fee ($9.75, or $7.00 with tip pass-through) — not 30% commission
- **Accept pickup orders** at $0 delivery fee
- **Track savings** vs. marketplace fees in real time on their dashboard
- **Manage their menu** with a full CRUD builder
- **View analytics** — revenue, top items, busiest days, cumulative savings

## 💰 The Problem

Restaurants on DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats pay **30% commission** on every order. On a $35 order, that's $10.50 gone — while most restaurants operate on 3–9% margins.

**RestaurantSaaS replaces that** with:
| | Marketplace | RestaurantSaaS |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery fee | 30% of order ($10.50 on $35) | Flat $7.00–$9.75 |
| Pickup fee | ~15% of order | **$0** |
| Monthly savings (200 orders) | — | **$2,100+** |

## 🚗 DoorDash Drive Integration

The platform uses DoorDash Drive's **quote → accept** flow:

1. Customer places a delivery order
2. Restaurant confirms → system creates a DoorDash quote
3. Quote accepted → Dasher dispatched
4. Status updates via webhooks: `confirmed → enroute → pickup → delivered`

**Pricing:**
- Base rate: $9.75 (first 5 miles)
- Tip discount: -$2.75 if tips passed to Dasher
- Minimum fee with tips: **$7.00**
